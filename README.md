# sima_clock
A simple esp8266 and 8 bit neopixel ring light based clock
its like a normal clock but cool becuase it has leds!
because its 8 bit, it has only 8 leds, so i had to improvise

so if its 16:00, it will show in the down right corner and glow ðŸŸ¢
if its 17:00, it will glow ðŸ”´

so if its 19:00, it will show in the down right corner and glow ðŸŸ¢
if its 20:00, it will glow ðŸ”´
